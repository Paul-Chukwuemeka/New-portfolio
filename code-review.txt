# Senior Engineer Code Review

Here is a review of your codebase with a list of potential improvements.

## 1. Logical Mistakes & Edge Cases

*   **Contact Form Inoperable**:
    *   The contact form in `src/components/features/contact/Contact.tsx` is currently non-functional. It lacks state management for inputs, an `onSubmit` handler, and any validation logic. This means users can't actually submit the form.
    *   **Recommendation**: Implement state management (e.g., with `useState`) for the form fields, add an `onSubmit` handler to process the data (even if it's just a `console.log` for now), and add basic client-side validation.

*   **Context Default Value**:
    *   In `src/contexts/AppContexts.tsx`, the default value for `setSideBar` in `createContext` is an empty function `() => {}`. If a component using this context accidentally renders without the `AppContextProvider`, calling `setSideBar` will fail silently, which can make debugging difficult.
    *   **Recommendation**: To catch this issue early, make the default function throw an error. Example: `setSideBar: () => { throw new Error("setSideBar function must be used within an AppContextProvider"); }`.

## 2. Naming Conventions & Styling

*   **Inconsistent Naming**:
    *   There are minor inconsistencies in file naming (e.g., `Constant.ts` vs. `AppContexts.tsx`).
    *   **Recommendation**: Standardize file naming. For example: `constants.ts`, `appContext.tsx`.
    *   The component `Wrapper.tsx` is too generic. A name like `PageLayout.tsx` would be more descriptive of its purpose.

*   **Inconsistent Styling & Magic Numbers**:
    *   The codebase uses many "magic numbers" and custom values in Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `h-70`, `w-220`, `gap-[15px_25px]`, `shadow-[0px_0px_10px]`). This makes the design inconsistent and hard to maintain.
    *   **Recommendation**: Add these custom values to your `tailwind.config.mjs` file under the `theme.extend` key. This will allow you to reuse them, ensure consistency, and give them meaningful names.

*   **Complex and Mixed Styling**:
    *   In `Hero.tsx`, a `highlight` variable is used for some styles, but then many other styles are applied directly in the JSX, making it hard to read and manage.
    *   **Recommendation**: Consolidate component-specific styles. If a group of styles is used repeatedly, consider creating a dedicated component or a more comprehensive set of base styles.

## 3. Performance Optimizations

*   **Global CSS Selectors**:
    *   In `src/app/globals.css`, the universal selector (`*`) is used for scrollbar styling and selection styling. This can negatively impact rendering performance, as the browser has to apply these styles to every single element on the page.
    *   **Recommendation**: Apply scrollbar styling to the `body` or `html` tags instead of the universal selector.

*   **Image Optimization**:
    *   The `next/image` component in `Projects.tsx` is used correctly, which is great for performance.
    *   **Recommendation**: Double-check that the provided `width` (1400) and `height` (500) attributes reflect the actual aspect ratio and are the optimal size for the layout to prevent layout shifts and unnecessary data loading.

*   **DOM Element Proliferation**:
    *   In `Hero.tsx` and `HeroSide.tsx`, strings are split into individual characters and rendered into separate `<span>` or `<div>` elements to create animations. This creates a large number of DOM nodes, which can slow down rendering and increase memory usage.
    *   **Recommendation**: For the "Paul Chukwuemeka" text, consider applying the animation to the words instead of individual letters to reduce the DOM element count. Alternatively, investigate more performant animation techniques, perhaps with a library like GSAP (which you already have as a dependency) that can handle this more efficiently.

## 4. Security Vulnerabilities

*   **Insecure Links**:
    *   In `src/components/ui/ViewBtn.tsx`, you have a link that opens in a new tab (`target="_blank"`). However, the `rel` attribute has a typo: `norefferer` instead of `noreferrer`. Missing or incorrect `rel="noopener noreferrer"` on `target="_blank"` links creates a security vulnerability called "tabnabbing."
    *   **Recommendation**: Correct the typo in `ViewBtn.tsx` to `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

*   **Form Submission Vulnerabilities**:
    *   As the contact form is not functional, this is not an immediate threat. However, if you were to implement it, the current lack of validation and sanitization would make it vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other injection attacks.
    *   **Recommendation**: When you implement the form, ensure you validate and sanitize all user input on both the client-side and, more importantly, the server-side before processing or storing it.

## 5. Accessibility (a11y)

*   **Missing Form Labels**:
    *   The inputs in the contact form are missing associated `<label>` elements. Placeholders are not a substitute for labels for screen readers.
    *   **Recommendation**: Add `<label>` elements for each input and use the `htmlFor` attribute to link them to the `id` of the input. You can visually hide the labels if you prefer, but they should be present in the DOM for screen readers.

*   **Redundant Button in Link**:
    *   In `ShareBtn.tsx`, there is a `<button>` inside a `<Link>`. This is redundant and can be confusing for screen readers.
    *   **Recommendation**: Remove the `<button>` and apply the `aria-label` and styling directly to the `<a>` tag.

## 6. Code Readability and Maintainability

*   **Unconventional UI/UX Choices**:
    *   The vertically rotated text in `NavBar.tsx` is difficult to read and not a standard navigation pattern.
    *   The `line-through` style for the active link could be misinterpreted by users as a disabled or "crossed-off" item.
    *   **Recommendation**: Consider a more conventional navigation design for better usability. For active links, a different color, background, or a simple underline are more common and intuitive patterns.

*   **Hardcoded Data**:
    *   The `projects` in `Constant.ts` and `texts` in `HeroSide.tsx` are hardcoded. As your portfolio grows, this will become harder to manage.
    *   **Recommendation**: Consider moving this data to a more scalable solution, like a headless CMS or even just separate JSON files, which can be imported and mapped over.
