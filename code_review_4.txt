Senior Engineer Code Review

This document provides a code review of the portfolio project, focusing on potential improvements in logic, style, performance, security, and maintainability.

**General Observations**

The codebase is generally well-structured and follows modern React and Next.js practices. The use of TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and a clear component-based architecture is commendable. The code is readable and the file organization is logical. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made, particularly in security, user experience, and error handling.

**File-specific Feedback**

**`src/app/api/send/route.ts`**

*   **Security Vulnerability:** The code uses `dompurify` on the server side to sanitize input. `dompurify` is a client-side library that depends on browser APIs (like the `window` object) and will not work correctly in a Node.js environment. This means the sanitization is likely not happening, leaving the application vulnerable to XSS attacks if the sanitized data is ever rendered without proper encoding.
    *   **Recommendation:** Replace `dompurify` with a library designed for server-side use, such as `isomorphic-dompurify` or `xss-clean`.
*   **Security:** The `from` email address in `resend.emails.send` is hardcoded as `"onboarding@resend.dev"`. This is a placeholder from the Resend documentation and should be replaced with a verified domain that you own. Using the default address may cause emails to be marked as spam.
*   **Error Handling:** The error handling is too generic. The `catch` block catches errors from `resend.emails.send` but returns a generic "Error sending email" message.
    *   **Recommendation:** Provide more specific error messages. For example, distinguish between validation errors, Resend API errors, and other unexpected errors. This will make debugging much easier.
*   **Input Validation:** The email validation regex is very basic and will not catch all invalid email formats.
    *   **Recommendation:** Use a more robust email validation library like `zod` or a more comprehensive regex to ensure data integrity.

**`src/components/features/contact/Contact.tsx`**

*   **User Experience:** The form provides no feedback to the user upon submission. The user does not know if the email was sent successfully or if an error occurred.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement a loading state to indicate that the form is being submitted. After submission, display a success or error message to the user.
*   **State Management:** The form uses three separate `useState` hooks for the form fields. While this is acceptable for a small form, it can become cumbersome as the form grows.
    *   **Recommendation:** Consider using a single `useState` hook with an object to manage the form state, or use the `useReducer` hook for more complex forms. This will make the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
*   **Error Handling:** The `catch` block in `handleSendMail` only logs the error to the console. The user is not notified of the error.
    *   **Recommendation:** Update the UI to inform the user that an error has occurred.

**`src/components/layout/NavBar.tsx`**

*   **Accessibility & UX:** The active navigation link is styled with `line-through`. While `aria-current="page"` is correctly used for screen readers, the visual `line-through` style can be confusing for users, as it typically signifies a completed or unavailable item.
    *   **Recommendation:** Choose a different visual indicator for the active link, such as a different color, a bolder font weight, or a persistent underline, to improve user experience.

**`src/Constant.ts`**

*   **Scalability:** The `projects` array is stored in this file. As the number of projects increases, this file will become larger and harder to manage.
    *   **Recommendation:** For better scalability, consider moving the project data to a separate JSON file or fetching it from a headless CMS or a database. This will make it easier to update the project list without changing the code.

**`src/components/features/about/HeroSide.tsx`**

*   **CSS Readability:** The component uses long strings of Tailwind CSS utility classes, which can be difficult to read and maintain.
    *   **Recommendation:** To improve readability, consider creating reusable component classes using `@apply` in a separate CSS file, or create smaller, more focused components to encapsulate some of the styling.

**Summary of Recommendations**

1.  **Critical:** Replace `dompurify` with a server-side compatible library (e.g., `isomorphic-dompurify`) in `src/app/api/send/route.ts` to fix the XSS vulnerability.
2.  **High:** Implement user feedback (loading, success, error states) in the contact form in `src/components/features/contact/Contact.tsx`.
3.  **High:** Change the `from` address in `resend.emails.send` to a custom, verified domain.
4.  **Medium:** Improve the active link styling in `NavBar.tsx` for better UX.
5.  **Medium:** Enhance input validation in the contact form and API route.
6.  **Low:** Consider moving project data to a separate file or a CMS for better scalability.
7.  **Low:** Refactor the CSS in `HeroSide.tsx` to improve readability.
