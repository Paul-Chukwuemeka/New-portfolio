### Code Review and Improvement Suggestions

This document provides a review of the codebase, highlighting areas for improvement in terms of logic, edge cases, naming conventions, performance, security, and overall code quality.

### 1. Logical Mistakes and Edge Cases

*   **`AppContexts.tsx`**: The default `setSideBar` function in the context throws an error. This is good for development, but it's better to provide a no-op function `() => {}` for the default value to prevent potential runtime errors if the context is ever used without a provider in a test environment or a part of the app that is not wrapped in the provider.
*   **`Contact.tsx`**: The `handleSendMail` function has a `console.log(data)` and `console.error(error)`. These should be removed in production. Also, the error handling is a bit generic. It would be better to provide more specific error messages to the user based on the error received from the API.
*   **`Projects.tsx`**: The component uses `useEffect` with `setMounted(true)` to prevent a hydration mismatch error with the theme. This is a common workaround, but it causes the page to render a loading skeleton on the first load, which is not ideal for user experience. A better approach would be to use a cookie-based theme provider or to handle the theme on the server side.
*   **`send/route.ts`**: The environment variables `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_TO_EMAIL`, and `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` are used with a non-null assertion (`!`). This can lead to runtime errors if the environment variables are not set. It's better to check if the variables are defined and throw an error if they are not.

### 2. Naming Conventions and Styling

*   **Inconsistent Naming**:
    *   Component file names are in `PascalCase` (e.g., `NavBar.tsx`), which is good. However, some page files are named `page.tsx`, which is the Next.js convention, but it can be confusing when you have multiple `page.tsx` files in different folders. Consider giving them more descriptive names, like `contact-page.tsx`.
    *   In `Constant.ts`, the `tools` array has `language` as a property, but it contains names of technologies, not just languages (e.g., "React", "NextJs"). A better name would be `name` or `technology`.
    *   In `HeroSide.tsx`, the class `h-70` and `w-70` are used. These are not standard Tailwind CSS classes. It seems like you have custom classes defined. It's better to use standard Tailwind classes or define them in the `tailwind.config.js` file.
*   **Styling**:
    *   The CSS in `globals.css` is a mix of standard CSS, `@theme`, and `@custom-variant`. It would be better to stick to one way of defining styles, preferably using Tailwind CSS's configuration and utility classes.
    *   There are many `max-lg:` and `max-md:` prefixes used for responsive design. While this works, it can make the code harder to read. Consider using a more structured approach to responsive design, like defining responsive variants in the `tailwind.config.js` file.

### 3. Performance Optimizations

*   **Image Optimization**: In `Projects.tsx`, the images are loaded with `placeholder="blur"`. This is good, but you could also consider using a smaller image for the blur placeholder to reduce the initial page load size.
*   **Lottie Animations**: The `Completed.tsx` and `Error.tsx` components use Lottie animations. These are great for user experience, but they can be large files. Make sure the JSON files for the animations are as small as possible.
*   **Code Splitting**: The pages are already code-split by Next.js, which is great. However, you could also consider code-splitting some of the larger components that are not immediately visible on the page, like the `Projects` component.

### 4. Security Vulnerabilities

*   **`send/route.ts`**: The code uses `DOMPurify.sanitize` to sanitize the `name` and `message` fields. This is a good step to prevent XSS attacks. However, the `email` field is not sanitized. While it's less likely to be a vector for XSS, it's still a good practice to sanitize all user input. Also, you are using `isomorphic-dompurify`, which is good for server-side rendering, but you should ensure that the configuration is strict enough to prevent all possible XSS attacks.
*   **Dependencies**: The `package.json` file shows that you are using `next@15.5.2`. It's important to keep your dependencies up to date to avoid any known security vulnerabilities. You can use a tool like `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities.

### 5. Code Clarity and Documentation

*   **`Constant.ts`**: The `texts` array is a bit ambiguous. It's not immediately clear what "PC" and "FS" stand for without looking at the `HeroSide.tsx` component. Adding a comment to explain this would be helpful.
*   **`HeroSide.tsx`**: The component has a lot of Tailwind CSS classes, which can make it hard to read. Consider creating custom components for some of the repeated styles or using a library like `clsx` to conditionally apply classes.
*   **`README.md`**: The `README.md` is good, but it could be improved by adding a section on the project's architecture and how to contribute to the project.

### 6. Debugging Code

*   **`Contact.tsx`**: As mentioned before, there are `console.log` and `console.error` statements that should be removed.

### 7. Other Improvements

*   **Accessibility**:
    *   In `ShareBtn.tsx`, the `aria-label` for the links are "Github" and "Linkedin". It would be better to provide more descriptive labels, like "View my Github profile".
    *   In `NavBar.tsx`, the `aria-label` for the sidebar button is "sidebar button". A more descriptive label would be "Open sidebar".
*   **State Management**: The app uses a mix of `useState` and `useContext` for state management. This is fine for a small app, but for a larger app, you might want to consider using a more robust state management library like Redux or Zustand.
*   **Testing**: There are no tests in the project. Adding unit tests for the components and integration tests for the API endpoints would improve the code quality and make it easier to maintain.
